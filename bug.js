The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the promise resolves. This is particularly common when fetching data from Firestore.  For instance, if you attempt to directly access `snapshot.data().name` before the data is fully fetched, you'll get an error.  Another subtle error can occur when using `onSnapshot` without proper cleanup.  If your component unmounts while the listener is still active, this can lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior.
